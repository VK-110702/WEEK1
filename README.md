# Final Project
It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify and distinguish between organic and inorganic waste. By training the model on a dataset of waste images, the CNN is able to accurately predict the type of waste . The project includes image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using popular deep learning frameworks.
